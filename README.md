# Blackboard
An HTML scraping, JavaScript injecting, spaghettificating, massive heap of Blackboard parsing mobile client.

This client is only verified to work with the blackboard site for NASD, and will likely break if used to access another organization. It contains heaps of illogical spaghetti that would make barely any sense to anyone unfamiliar to NASD's blackboard page. However, it should be relatively easy to make a fork that works with another blackboard site with substantially less headaches than it took to make this project.

[Blackboard](http://www.blackboard.com/) is a website/software package/whatever used by educational organizations/schools/things to organize scheduling/assignments/stuff. As I have many gripes about their [official android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blackboard.android.bbstudent), specifically things like: slow/inefficient navigation impeded by excessive animations, NOT BEING ABLE TO CLICK URLs IN THE DESCRIPTION OF AN ASSIGNMENT (this almost cost me a grade), and a general lack of planning and design, I decided to put my plentiful website scraping experience to good use and make my own version. While it is somewhat unstable and currently lacks some pretty major features (such as submitting assignments - this would definitely not function as a replacement for the official app), it is definitely an improvement for simply checking announcements, downloading files, or reading assignments on a fast network.
