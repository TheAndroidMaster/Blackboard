# Blackboard
An HTML scraping, JavaScript injecting, spaghettificating, massive heap of Blackboard parsing mobile client.

This client is only verified to work with the blackboard site for NASD, and will likely break if used to access another organization. It contains heaps of illogical spaghetti that would make barely any sense to anyone unfamiliar to NASD's blackboard page. However, it should be relatively easy to make a fork that works with another blackboard site with substantially less headaches than it took to make this project.
